Use absolute top-scope notation (i.e. %{::clientcert} instead of %{clientcert}) in Hiera’s 
config files to avoid accidentally accessing a local variable instead of a top-scope one.





If a value is found:
In a normal (priority) lookup, Hiera will stop at the first data source with the requested data and return that value.
In an array lookup, Hiera will continue, then return all of the discovered values as a flattened array. Values from higher 
in the hierarchy will be the first elements in the array, and values from lower will be later.
In a hash lookup, Hiera will continue, expecting every value to be a hash and throwing an error if any non-hash values are 
discovered. It will then merge all of the discovered hashes and return the result, allowing values from higher in the hierarchy to replace values from lower.

hiera('')
hiera_array('')
hiera_hash('')


If Hiera goes through the entire hierarchy without finding a value, it will use the default value if one was provided, or fail with an error if one wasn’t.

hiera('',defaultvalue)
